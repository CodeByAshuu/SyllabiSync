🔹 Core Functionalities
✔️ User Authentication (Login/Register) 
✔️ Dashboard (Different for Admin & Institutes) 
✔️ Curriculum Management (CRUD for Subjects, Syllabi, PDFs, etc.) 
✔️ Approval System (Admins approve curriculum updates) 
✔️ Search & Filter by Course, Branch, and Institute 
✔️ File Uploads (PDFs, DOCs, etc.) 
✔️ Version Control (Track changes to curricula over time)
